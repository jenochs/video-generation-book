1. **Environment Setup** - Verify A100 and configure optimizations
2. **Install Dependencies** - Latest PyTorch and diffusers
3. **Load HunyuanVideo** - Download and optimize the 13B model
4. **Generate Videos** - Create your first AI video!

## üìä Performance Expectations

### A100 40GB Performance
| Quality Setting | Resolution | Duration | Memory Usage | Generation Time |
|----------------|------------|----------|--------------|-----------------|
| **High Quality** | 720x1280 | ~8s (65 frames) | ~35GB | 8-12 minutes |
| **Balanced** | 544x960 | ~8s (65 frames) | ~25GB | 6-10 minutes |
| **Fast** | 512x512 | ~4s (32 frames) | ~15GB | 3-6 minutes |

### Tips for Best Results
- **Use descriptive prompts**: "A majestic eagle soaring over mountains at sunset, cinematic camera movement"
- **Include camera details**: "slow motion", "wide angle", "close-up"
- **Specify atmosphere**: "dramatic lighting", "golden hour", "misty morning"
- **Set consistent seeds**: For reproducible results across experiments

## üé¨ Example Prompts

### Nature & Wildlife
```
A hummingbird feeding from vibrant tropical flowers, macro lens, slow motion, beautiful natural lighting
```

### Urban & Architecture  
```
A futuristic cyberpunk city at night, neon reflections in rain puddles, flying cars, cinematic atmosphere
```

### Fantasy & Sci-Fi
```
A dragon flying through clouds above a medieval castle, epic fantasy scene, golden hour lighting
```

### Abstract & Artistic
```
Colorful paint mixing in water, abstract fluid dynamics, high-speed macro photography, artistic lighting
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

**‚ùå "Runtime disconnected"**
- Colab has 12-hour session limits
- Save progress to Google Drive regularly
- Use checkpoint system in notebook

**‚ùå "CUDA out of memory"**  
- Switch to "Fast" quality preset
- Reduce num_frames (try 32 instead of 65)
- Restart runtime to clear memory

**‚ùå "Model download failed"**
- Check internet connection
- Verify sufficient disk space (~30GB needed)
- Try running download cell again

**‚ùå "A100 not available"**
- A100 availability varies by region and time
- Try different times of day
- Consider using T4 with reduced settings
