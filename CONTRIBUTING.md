) -> List[torch.Tensor]:
    """Process multiple videos in batches for memory efficiency.
    
    This function implements batched processing to handle large video
    datasets without exceeding GPU memory limits. Videos are automatically
    resized if they exceed max_resolution.
    
    Memory Usage:
        - 8GB VRAM: batch_size=1, max_resolution=256
        - 16GB VRAM: batch_size=2, max_resolution=512  
        - 24GB+ VRAM: batch_size=4, max_resolution=1024
    
    Args:
        video_paths: List of file paths to video files
        batch_size: Number of videos to process simultaneously
        max_resolution: Maximum height/width in pixels
        
    Returns:
        List of processed video tensors
        
    Example:
        >>> paths = ["video1.mp4", "video2.mp4"]
        >>> tensors = process_video_batch(paths, batch_size=2)
        >>> print(f"Processed {len(tensors)} videos")
    """
```

### Testing Requirements

#### **Model Tests**
```python
def test_model_inference():
    """Test basic model functionality across hardware configurations."""
    # Test with minimal prompt
    prompt = "A cat walking"
    
    # Test memory optimization features
    model = load_model_with_optimization()
    output = model.generate(prompt, max_frames=16)
    
    assert output.shape[0] == 16  # Correct frame count
    assert output.dtype == torch.float16  # Memory optimization
    assert torch.all(output >= 0) and torch.all(output <= 1)  # Valid range
```

#### **Integration Tests**
